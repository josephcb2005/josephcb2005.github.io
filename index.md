I am a Computer Science major at CSUF, and I am planning to graduate around 2028-2029. 
I have some early knowledge on some aspects of Computer Science, because before coming to CSUF, I learned how to work with Roblox Studio, where I learned how to make games, use basic developer practices and some concepts that helped me learn faster, such as Object Oriented Programming.


## * Favorite CPSC 120L Lab Assignments

## [Lab 12] 

Lab 12 was pretty fun to do, because I was able to make a .gif file for the first time that plays an animated gradient effect.

## [Lab 10]

Lab 10 is the first assignment that I had to figure out completely on my own and with the TODO's. The assignment also helped me get more comfortable with 2D vectors.

## [Lab 08]

This lab helped me learn how to use for-each loops when needed.
